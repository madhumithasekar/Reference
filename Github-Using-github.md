 git commit -m "revision one" 
```

  To find whether everyfile is committed use

```
git status
```

nothing to commit, working directory clean

## Step 6: List Commits

## To reverse the changes from staging environment

You are working on index.html(working environment) inside the editor. The staging enviroment might have an older version of index.html. To replace index.html inside the editor(working enviroment) with the index.html from the staging enviroment use

```
git checkout index.html -> This will not contain the file from staging enviroment

```

## To delete the file from staging enviroment. The below code works as if we are never meant to add index.html to the staging enviroment.

```
git reset HEAD index.html
```
